		Modified EvaFuelManager.onEvaStart to look up KerbalEVA.propellantResourceDefaultAmount
		and apply changes proportionally I.e. if that amount is equal to 5 (default value as per
		https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/class_kerbal_e_v_a.html#a7ce0916b13d2c62ac0e130a8aec2a33c),
		then full value of EvaTankFuelMax as configured in CustomSettings will be requested, or if
		this amount is 2, then only 2/5 * EvaTankFuelMax will be requested.
